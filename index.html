        <h2>Kabiguru of India</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore</b> FRAS (/rəˈbɪndrənɑːt tæˈɡɔːr/
          (listen); Bengali: রবীন্দ্রনাথ ঠাকুর pronounced [rɔˈbindɾɔnatʰ
          ˈʈʰakuɾ];[1] 7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941) was a Bengali polymath who
          worked as a poet, writer, playwright, composer, philosopher, social
          reformer and painter.[2][3][4] He reshaped Bengali literature and
          music as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th
          and early 20th centuries. Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh
          and beautiful" poetry of Gitanjali,[5] he became in 1913 the first
          non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in
          Literature.[6] Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and
          mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain
          largely unknown outside Bengal.[7] He was a fellow of the Royal
          Asiatic Society. Referred to as "the Bard of Bengal",[8][3][4] Tagore
          was known by sobriquets: Gurudeb, Kobiguru, Biswokobi.[a] A Bengali
          Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan
          district[10] and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an
          eight-year-old.[11] At the age of sixteen, he released his first
          substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha ("Sun Lion"), which
          were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.[12] By
          1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published
          under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist,
          and ardent critic of nationalism,[13] he denounced the British Raj and
          advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal
          Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings,
          sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs;
          his legacy also endures in his founding of Visva-Bharati
          University.[14][15] Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid
          classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels,
          stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and
          personal. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and
          Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his
          verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their
          lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His
          compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's
          "Jana Gana Mana" and Bangladesh's "Amar Shonar Bangla". The Sri Lankan
          national anthem was inspired by his work.[16] Family history See also:
          Tagore family The name Tagore is the anglicised transliteration of
          Thakur.[17] The original surname of the Tagores was Kushari. They were
          Pirali Brahmin ('Pirali’ historically carried a stigmatized and
          pejorative connotation)[18][19] originally belonged to a village named
          Kush in the district named Burdwan in West Bengal. The biographer of
          Rabindranath Tagore, Prabhat Kumar Mukhopadhyaya wrote in the first
          volume of his book Rabindrajibani O Rabindra Sahitya Prabeshak that
          The Kusharis were the descendants of Deen Kushari, the son of Bhatta
          Narayana; Deen was granted a village named Kush (in Burdwan zilla) by
          Maharaja Kshitisura, he became its chief and came to be known as
          Kushari.[10]
